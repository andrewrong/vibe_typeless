# TypelessApp Runtime Directory

This directory contains runtime files generated by the Swift application.

## Directory Structure

```
runtime/
├── logs/           # Application logs
│   ├── app-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log    # Timestamped log files
│   └── app.pid                    # Running app process ID
└── tmp/            # Temporary files
```

## Logs

### View Latest Logs

```bash
# View the most recent log
cat runtime/logs/app-*.log | tail -100

# Real-time log monitoring
tail -f runtime/logs/app-*.log

# Search for errors
grep ERROR runtime/logs/app-*.log
```

### Log File Format

Log files are timestamped: `app-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log`

Example: `app-20250204-142530.log`

### Log Contents

The logs capture:
- Standard output from Swift application
- Error messages
- Debug information
- API request/response logs

### Clean Up Old Logs

```bash
# Remove logs older than 7 days
find runtime/logs -name "*.log" -mtime +7 -delete

# Keep only the latest 5 logs
cd runtime/logs
ls -t app-*.log | tail -n +6 | xargs rm --

# Remove all logs
rm -rf runtime/logs/*.log
```

## Process Management

### Check if App is Running

```bash
# Using PID file
if [ -f runtime/logs/app.pid ]; then
    PID=$(cat runtime/logs/app.pid)
    ps -p $PID && echo "Running" || echo "Not running"
fi

# Using pgrep
pgrep -f TypelessApp
```

## Disk Space

Check runtime directory size:

```bash
# Total size
du -sh runtime/

# Breakdown
du -sh runtime/logs runtime/tmp

# Log files only
du -sh runtime/logs/*.log
```

## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Start

Check the log file for errors:

```bash
tail -50 runtime/logs/app-*.log
```

### App Crashed

Review the last log:

```bash
# Find the most recent log
LATEST_LOG=$(ls -t runtime/logs/app-*.log 2>/dev/null | head -1)

# View it
cat "$LATEST_LOG"
```

### High Memory/CPU Usage

1. Check if the app is still running:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep TypelessApp
   ```

2. If needed, force stop:
   ```bash
   ./stop.sh
   ```

3. Check logs for issues

## Notes

- This directory is ignored by Git (see `.gitignore`)
- New log files are created each time the app starts
- Old logs can accumulate - clean up periodically
- Temporary files are automatically managed by the app
